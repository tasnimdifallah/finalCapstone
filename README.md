This repositry cotains two of my previous capstone projects.

## Capstone Projects

### Holiday Cost Calculator | holiday.py
This code is a simple holiday cost calculator that calculates the total cost of a holiday based on the user's inputs for the city they will be flying to, the number of nights they will be staying at the hotel, and the number of days they will be hiring a car.

### Minesweeper Game | holidayminesweeper.py
This code implements a simplified version of the Minesweeper game. The sweeper function takes a 2D list of mines as input and returns a modified 2D list that represents the game board, where each cell either contains a mine or the count of neighboring mines.
